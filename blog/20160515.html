<p>After this site went virtually untouched for 6 months, I decided to start from
scratch. I&#39;ve always liked the look websites made in the 90s, so I tried to
recreate a little bit of that, but use modern tools.</p>
<p>Not sure what I&#39;m going to do with site yet, but ideally there will be something
useful here eventually.</p><hr></div><div class="push"></div></body><div class="footer"><div class="container"><em>last deployment: Fri Aug 26 2016 07:10:41 GMT+0000 (UTC) (<a href="https://github.com/jcpst/jcpst">source</a>)</em></div></div></html>
